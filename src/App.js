      <p>The Framework I decided to use was React.</p>
      <p>React is a very good Framework that implements Javascript, HTML and CSS all in one folder by downloading an APP.</p>

      <div class = "steps">
        <h2>Steps I took to set up this Framework</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Download Git and Node.js</li>
            <li>Create the folders needed on the local computer for react website</li>
            <li>Create new directory on github to store all the code needed for website</li>
            <li>Edit the package.json file to store the HOMEPAGE</li>
            <li>Connect the react script with GIT using git commands</li>
            <li>Push code into the git repository</li>
            <li>Upload code to the git repository</li>
            <li>View website: https://yugipoke27.github.io/react-deploy/</li>
          </ol> 
      </div>

    </div>
      <p>Difficulties Encountered</p>
      <p>I was unable to connect the code with git initially. Was able to fix this error by researching the git commands needed</p>
      <p>Unable to see changes on the webside. Was able to fix this by runnning the program locally before pushing to git</p>
      
      <p>Overall the process of setting up React Framework was very simple and I would reccomend</p>
